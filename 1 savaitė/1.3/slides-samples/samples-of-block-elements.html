        The &lt;p&gt; HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks
        of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be
        any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.
    </p>
    <blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote">
        The &lt;blockquote&gt; HTML element indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is
        rendered visually by indentation (see Notes for how to change it). A URL for the source of the quotation may be
        given using the cite attribute.
