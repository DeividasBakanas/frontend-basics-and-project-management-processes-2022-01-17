        <em>
            The &lt;em&gt; HTML element marks text that has stress emphasis. The &lt;em&gt; element can be nested, with
            each
            level of nesting indicating a greater degree of emphasis.
        </em>

        <strong>
            The &lt;strong&gt; HTML element indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency.
            Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.
        </strong>

    <br>
    The &lt;br&gt; HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an
    address, where the division of lines is significant.

            The &lt;q&gt; HTML element indicates that the enclosed text is a short inline quotation. Most modern
            browsers implement this by surrounding the text in quotation marks. This element is intended for short
            quotations that don't require paragraph breaks.
